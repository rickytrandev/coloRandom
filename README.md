# COLORANDOM


### Abstract
Designers often face creative blocks when trying to come up with new color schemes for their projects. A random color palette generator can provide them with fresh and unique color combinations, sparking creativity and inspiration. People working on personal projects, such as crafting, painting, or home decoration, may use the app to discover color palettes that suit their tastes and preferences.

### Context
As mod1 students in the Turing program (week 4 of the program), we worked on this project as a group of 4 over the time period of a week (Monday-Sunday). We utilized HTML, ES5 JavaScript, and CSS to build the project. We leveraged tools such as VSCode Liveshare and Zoom to work synchronously, as well as Slack when working asynchronously.

### Wins and Challenges
The biggest challenge we faced was navigating through the project as a group, as it was all of our first times coding as part of a team. We were able to complete the required iterations and debug the project before the project deadline.
